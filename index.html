<p style="font-family:Courier new"><font color="blue"</font>9/2/2022-Today we were doing tinker cad. It was really fun and enojyable and opened up a new side of computer for me. We are also posting our websites to a google doc and I think that this class is going to be very intresting and I am excited for the classes ahead.</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new">9/16/2022- Today we built paper boats and put them in water with a certain amount of weight to see if it could hold for five minutes. It was intresting to see the different types of models and builds that were presented and was a nice way to spend time outside as class to creat bonds and friendships.</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new">9/23/2022- Today we finally tested our builds in class. Ours turned out succesful and it was fun seeing other projects and their results. I was able to use critical thinking skills with peers to create the amazing project. </p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new">9/30/2022- Today we were able to disect a computer and see the various parts inside of the computer. It is a intresting expirience seeing the inner parts of a computer and it helps further understand how it functions and it was a lot of fun. Doing this with my groupmates allowed to us to bond even more and it was a enjoyable expirience.</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new">10/4/022- Today we were building prostetics for animals on TinkerCad for animals. Today I decided to build a prostetic for a parrot and made a prostetic wing. It was cool and exciting to know and understand that prostetics can be used for many uses and not just human parts</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new">10/7/2022- Today we were doing a expiriment with a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich. We followed exact instrucitons on how to make a peanut butter sandwhich and turned into a mess. A lesson taught to us today with this expiriment was that with computer, instructions must be accurate and exact for it to work and make sense. It was a fun to look at computer science in a different way.</p>
