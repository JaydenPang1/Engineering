<h2>Engineering Journal</h2>
<p>9/2/2022-Today we were doing tinker cad. It was really fun and enojyable and opened up a new side of computer for me. We are also posting our websites to a google doc and I think that this class is going to be very intresting and I am excited for the classes ahead.</p>
<p>9/16/2022- Today we built paper boats and put them in water with a certain amount of weight to see if it could hold for five minutes. It was intresting to see the different types of models and builds that were presented and was a nice way to spend time outside as class to creat bonds and friendships.</p>
